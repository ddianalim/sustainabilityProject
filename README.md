TeenTechSF 2018 

Nulla is an app which allows users to live a lifestyle of zero waste by tracking the different tasks they complete and rewarding them with points.

*************************************************************

## To Set Up
## Before you start: 
Make sure you have Xcode version 9.2 downloaded on your computer (you must have an Apple computer in order to have Xcode). 
1. Download the zip from the Github repository. Then click on the zip file and open the folder, titled sustainabilityProject-master.
2. Open up the Xcode workspace titled sustainabilityProject.xcodeproj 
3. If a pop up asks you: "'sustainabilityProject' is a project downloaded from the Internet. Are you sure you want to open it?", click [Open] :) 
4. Now you have the project open, do Command B. This will build the project in XCode. Xcode Simulator should open up, and you will see the app running on an iPhone in a moment. (If this doesn't work, make sure you've selected a iOS Simulator (try iPhone X!) to run sustainabilityProject on.)
5. Play around with our app! Experiment by adding points to your profile, and reading about the different actions you can take to practice a ZeroWaste lifestyle and live more sustainability. Enjoy :)
